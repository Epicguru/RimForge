  <description>A mid-tech modpack that add new materials, weapons, turrets, power, utilities and more:

* Power lines (wow, very pretty, such aesthetic).
* Wireless electrical power.
* Tesla coils! Fry those raiders!
* A huge mounted coilgun that can fire through mountains.
* Many new metal alloys: bronze, gilded plasteel, staballoy etc. With unique stats and purposes.
* A forge, to create metal alloys, with a forge temperature system.
* New melee weapons. Some require the new alloys. No particular theme.
* New 'stabilized' guns, with Bronze as their main crafting material. Improved accuracy but reduced damage.
* A greenhouse controller, to greatly accelerate crop growth indoors.
* Mercury Ultraweave, an upgrade from devilstrand and hyperweave.
* A 'blessing' and 'curse' system. Sacrifice a prisoner to receive the blessing of the machine god, but beware cursed raiders.
* Blessed and Cursed unique weapons, that have special effects and buffs / debuffs when used.
* A strike drone. You can add carpet bombing tribals to your list of crimes against humanity.

Also supports:

[Combat Extended]
Some recipes are changed for balance purposes. 
Allows for stuffable melee weapons to be crafted out of certain alloys (CE normally forces all melee weapons to use Steel, Uranium or Plasteel).
Balance of new melee weapons and guns may need tweaking, please give feedback.

Shows useful information about the mod's items and buildings, such as how to set up the forge.
