#This weapon is not craftable.
It is carried by attackers who are afflicted by Zir's Corruption.
Whenever a raid starts that contains these special raiders, you will receive a unique warning notification next to the raid notification.
This allows you to prepare for these raiders, as they are very strong, mostly due to them carrying this powerful sword.

<b>Any pawn that equips this weapon will receive a large mood debuff unless they are corrupted.</b>

These swords are a valuable artifact and can be sold for a hefty sum to traders.
