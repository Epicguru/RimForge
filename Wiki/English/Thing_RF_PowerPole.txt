#!Power poles!#
#Wow, so pretty. Very industrial. Much aesthetic.
Power poles and cables work exactly as you would expect. They connect to each other and transfer an electrical current, just like regular cables.
In order to connect poles together, select the first pole and click on the <b>Connect to...</b> button.
This will then allow you to select the target pole. A cable will link these two poles, and electricity can flow.#

#!Auto connect#
#You may have realized that manually connecting poles becomes tedious, especially when you have many power poles.
The <b>Auto connect</b> button will automatically link up all power poles (and wall connectors) in an intelligent way that saves time and still looks good.

To begin, select all power poles by double-clicking on a pole. This will select all power poles that are visible on screen (so you may want to zoom out).
You can then click the auto connect button, and all poles will be linked.
You can also auto connect <b>wall connectors</b> and power poles at the same time.
To do this, first select all poles using the steps above, then hold the Shift key and double click on a wall selector. This will now select all wall connectors too.
You can then click the auto connect button.

<i>Note: Auto connecting will remove all existing connections.</i>#

#!Copper vs Tin#
#Copper and Tin power poles and cables are functionally identical, but tin poles will have grey cables whereas copper poles will have (you guessed it) copper-colored cables.#

#!Why can't I connect these poles?#
#<b> * </b>There is a maximum distance between power poles. This can be configured in the mod settings.
<b> * </b>Power poles don't work under roofs (they are too tall).#
