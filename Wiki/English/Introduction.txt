#Welcome to RimForge's wiki! Thank you for downloading my mod.#
#RimForge has 5 main areas: alloys, power, defences, weapons and deities#

#!Alloys#
#There are many new metal alloys to be created using the <b>Forge</b>.#
@RF_Forge@
#Each alloy has unique properties and uses, and some are required to build and craft items from this mod.
Check out the wiki pages for more info on each alloy.#

#!Power:#
#Power poles: unlocked with Electricity research, they work just as you would expect, carrying electrical currents in overhead cables.#
@RF_PowerPole@
#Lightning rods: unlocked with Electricity research. A lightning rod catches any lightning strike in a large radius and turns it into useful electrical energy.#
@RF_LightningRod@
#Fully wireless power using the <b>Wireless Power Pylons</b>, even across multiple maps:#
@RF_WirelessPowerPylon@

#!Defences#
#There are new ultra-powerful defences to keep your colony safe.
Front and foremost, the huge <b>Coilgun</b> can kill many enemies in a single shot, even behind cover:#
@RF_Coilgun@
A specialized strike drone, to do bombing runs on local targets or travel to distant maps to provide air support:
@RF_DroneLauncher@
#For tacticians who would rather keep their enemies alive, the <b>Tesla Coils</b> provide a reliable and convenient way to stun and electrocute any enemies that pass between them.#
@RF_TeslaCoil@
@RF_TeslaCoilWireless@

#!Weapons#
#Several new melee and ranged weapons are introduced. Most are very powerful but may require complex alloys to craft.
All are <i>Combat Extended</i> compatible.#
#<b>Melee Weapons:</b>#
@RF_GaeBulg@
@RF_VirtuousTreaty@
@RF_SwordOfDarkness@
@RF_SwordOfRapture@
#<b>Guns:</b>#
@RF_StableRifle@

#!Deities#
#Will you praise <color=\#ff6e63>Machine God Zir</color>?.
Using the <b>Ritual Core</b> you can perform a <i>blessing ritual</i> to greatly increase a colonist's machining, crafting and construction abilities, at the cost of a human life.
However doing so may anger fanatics within enemy factions... Dare to take this risk?#
