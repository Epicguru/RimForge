#!Basic Setup#
#You should construct this ritual core in an area with around 4 tiles of free space around it in each direction.
Once it has been constructed, you will be shown a 'ghost' blueprint, indicating where you should construct an additional 8 <color=\#ebbc46>Copper Columns</color>.
Once all of these columns have been built, the ritual is ready to begin.#

#!Ritual Requirements:#
#<b>1.</b> You must have a human prisoner to offer as a sacrifice.#
#<b>2.</b> You must draft up the target colonist and place them <b>directly adjacent to the ritual core</b>.#
#<b>3.</b> The ritual must be performed around midnight (can be disabled in settings).#
#Once all these conditions are met, click the <i>start ritual</i> button on the Ritual Core.
You will then be prompted to select the sacrifice, and the ritual will begin.
Throughout the duration of the ritual, <b>the target colonist must not move away from the ritual core</b>, or the ritual will be cancelled.#

#!Ritual#
#Once started the ritual will run for a couple of in-game hours. During this time the colonist must not move away from their spot.
Once the ritual is complete, the target colonist will receive the <color=\#f0e516>Blessing of Zir</color> trait.#

#!Repeating the ritual#
#The ritual can be performed again by sacrificing another prisoner and using a new colonist who does not already have the trait.
However, every time the ritual is completed there is an ever-increasing chance of the next ritual failing, with potentially lethal consequences.
You will be warned of this before the ritual begins, and you will be shown the percentage chance to fail.#
