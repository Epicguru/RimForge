#!Basic Requirements#
#You should construct this ritual core in an area with around 4 tiles of free space around it in each direction.
Once it has been constructed, you will be shown a 'ghost' blueprint, indicating where you should construct an additional 8 <color=/#ebbc46>Copper Columns</color>.
Once all of these columns have been built, the ritual is ready to begin.#
