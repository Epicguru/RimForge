#!How to use#
#The drone launcher must be loaded with mortar shells.
By default it uses regular High Explosive mortar shells, but the type of ammo can be changed by clicking the <i>Change bomb type</i> button.

Your colonists will automatically load the drone with the shells (it is a refuelling job).
<b>Note: You can change how many bombs are loaded by clicking the <i>Change max fuel</i> button.</b>#

#!Launching a drone strike#
#Once at least 1 bomb is loaded, you can click the <i>Launch Strike</i> button.
This will activate the targeting mode.

<b> - Click once to select the starting position.
 - Move your mouse and click again to select the end position.</b>
 
 Bombs will be dropped uniformly between these two positions.#
