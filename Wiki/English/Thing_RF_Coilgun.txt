#!How to set up#
#You must build at least 1 capacitor and connect it to the same power grid as the coilgun:#
@RF_Capacitor@
#This capacitor will charge over time. Note that it does not output power like a regular battery.
Now you can build the Coilgun in a strategic location.#
#<b>Important:</b>
The coilgun has a minumum range that is aproximately as large as the radius of it's barrel.
After this minumum range, anything and anyone standing between the gun and it's target will be killed, including friendly pawns.#

#!Ammo#
#There are a few different ammunition types that have different effects, strengths and weaknesses.
They are all <b>crafted at the Machining Bench</b>.
The Coilgun must be reloaded by a colonist after every shot.
You can change what ammo type the Coilgun uses by selecting it and pressing <i>Change shell type</i>#
@RF_CoilgunShellAP@
@RF_CoilgunShellSP@
@MachiningTable@

#!Firing#
#There are 3 conditions for the Coilgun to fire:
1. The coilgun must have power, just like a regular turret.
2. There must be at least 1 fully charged Capacitor on the power grid.
3. There must be a shell loaded in the gun.#
#Once these conditions are met, select the Coilgun and click <i>Fire at target</i>.
You can then select your target.
The red squares will indicate what positions will be hit by the projectile.
However, depending on the ammo used, the projectile may not travel the full distance indicated by the red squares if there are obstacles in the way.#
