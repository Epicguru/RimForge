#!About Mercury Ultraweave#
#A silky cloth that is more beautiful and much more resitant to damage than even devilstrand or hyperweave.
It is made by combining <color=\#15eded><b>Plasteel</b></color> and <color=\#e82309><b>Devilstrand</b></color> with <b>Mercury</b>:#
@RF_Mercury@
#It can be crafted at a tailoring bench after finishing the <color=\#e82309><b>Devilstrand</b></color> research.
However due to the complexity of this material only a colonist with the <color=\#f0e516>Blessing of Zir</color> trait will be able to craft it.
